"""Bounded, in-process lifecycle management for background analyses.

Analysis work is deliberately isolated from the request event loop.  Each
executor worker owns the event loop used by its analyzer runner and the
SQLAlchemy session created by the runner.  The registry remains in memory for
the single-Uvicorn-worker deployment, but all registry state is protected by a
threading lock so progress updates and polling are safe across worker threads.
